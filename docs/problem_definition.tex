To combat the issues associated with centralised marketplaces, tsukiji aims to be a fully decentralised marketplace.

A marketplace is a place where public sales are held.
In our case, a marketplace is a place where people can place bids or asks.
A bid is placed when a buyer wants to buy goods for a set price.
An ask is placed when a seller wants to sell goods for a set price.

Using the example of BitTorrent communities, a transaction would occur as follows: a seller places an "ask", wanting to sell 500 MBit for â‚¬3.
An interested buyer sees the ask and requests a trade to be made.
The buyer and seller exchange information necessary for the transaction to occur (e.g. bank account numbers).
A trade is made and the original ask is taken down.

Current marketplaces are centralised.
Information passes through one central point.
This means that if this central point fails, the entire marketplace is shut down.
A decentralised system operates without such a single point.
Instead of a central server connected to several users, peers are connected to each other.
