\section{Requirements}

The goal of this project is to create a decentralised marketplace.
The basics of a marketplace should work, so users have to be able to trade (virtual) commodities.
The system should be decentralised.
It should scale to thousands of users.
A nice user interface is not a priority, so only command line input is required.

Spoofing of message would of course be a big problem in a trading network.
However, since this is a solved problem, the focus of the project should be on other areas.

It would be nice to ensure the privacy of the users.

In order to achieve this, strong encryption of messages is required.
Further thought is also necessary on what information is exposed.
It would be nice to have a network resistant against hostile takeover.
Having a decentralised system plays a big role in this.
However, other attack vectors could also be possible.
Finally, it would be nice to trade real, verified commodities.
Before we can do this however, the requirements listed above should be satisfied first.
