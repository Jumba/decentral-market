The appearance of online marketplaces in the late 90s marked the beginning of a new era for consumers.
The connection between supplier and consumer is closer than ever.
Even trading between individuals has become commonplace.
Sites like ebay, Amazon and Alibaba all provide consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer and even business-to-business services.
Compared to traditional shopping, these platforms are easier to use, cost less time, have a wider range of products available and are better at matching buyer and seller.

Another example of such a marketplace is currency exchange platforms.
In recent years, Bitcoin has become of great interest to traders.
With the rise of interest in Bitcoin, the rise of Bitcoin exchange markets comes naturally.
The most famous of Bitcoin exchanges is the now defunct Mt.Gox.
Mt.Gox was plagued by problems early on that eventually led to its bankruptcy.
With its downfall, it took a large amount of funds with it.
The trust users have put into the institution was violated.

Similar stories exist all over the place. Hacking attempts, government shutdowns, or simply incompetent companies.
These are all common among marketplaces of all kinds.
In this report we present \textit{tsukiji}, a decentralized marketplace.
This proof-of-concept marketplace has no central server bottleneck, no central point of trust, full self-organisation, and unbounded scalability.
