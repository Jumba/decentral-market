The appearance of online marketplaces in the late 90s marked the beginning of a new era for consumers.
The connection between supplier and consumer is closer than ever.
Even trading between individuals has become commonplace.
Sites like ebay, Amazon and Alibaba all provide consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer and even business-to-business services.
These companies have seen explosive growth in the past decade.
