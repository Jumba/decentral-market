%Torrents
Over the past years the sharing of files has become more and more popular. 
With this, many ways to share files have risen and fallen.
Napster, Kazaa and LimeWire no longer exist, but there is one protocol that has survived many attempts of large companies, BitTorrent.
Released in 2001, BitTorrent offered a solution to the bottleneck of the existing websites.
It did not contain a central server that contained data or a single website that offered links to data for peer to peer sharing.
In the worst case, a large website containing links to trackers of files get taken down, but those can easily be available on a different website.
