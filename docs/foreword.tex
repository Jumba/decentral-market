\section{Preface}
This report describes the development process of creating a proof of concept for a decentral market, named Tsukiji. 
This proof of concept is created as part of the Bachelor Project course of the Computer Science program of Delft University of Technology.

We would like to thank Johan Pouwelse for giving us the opportunity to work on this project and provide guidance on how to attack the issue of decentralisation.
We also want to thank Raynor Vliegendhart for assisting us while developing the Bachelor Project report.
Finally, we want to give our thanks to Martha Larson and Felienne Hermans for supervising the project.
