\section*{Preface}
This report describes the development process of creating a proof of concept for a decentral market, named Tsukiji. 
This project was initiated as part of the TI3806 Bachelor Project course of the Computer Science program at the Delft University of Technology.

We would like to thank Johan Pouwelse for giving us the opportunity to work on this project and for providing guidance on how to attack the issue of decentralisation.
We also want to thank Raynor Vliegendhart for assisting us while developing the Bachelor Project report.
Finally, we want to give our thanks to Martha Larson and Felienne Hermans for supervising the project course.
