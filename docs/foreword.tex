\section{Preface}
This report will describe the development process of creating a proof of concept for a decentral market, named Tsukiji. 
This proof of concept is created as part of the Bachelor Project course of the Computer Science program of Delft University of Technology.\\
\\
We would like to thank Johan Pouwelse for giving us the oppotunity to work on this project and provide information on how to attack the issue of decentralisation. We also want to thank Raynor Vliegendhart for providing guidance on developing the Bachelor Project thesis in the right way. Finally we want to give our thanks to Marta Larson and Felienne Hermans, for supervising the project and giving us the time to develop a strong proof of concept.\\
