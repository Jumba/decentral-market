\section{Conclusion}
The goal of this project was to create a proof of concept for a decentralised market where user could trade commodities for real money without accessing a central server and with no governing authority.
Tsukiji manages to show that this concept is definitely possible. It can connect users to a subset of the network that communicates with other groups of users via the gossip protocol.
Using the PayPal API, the responsibility of handling payments and real bank transfers is taken away from Tsukiji.
That API also enables anonymity within Tsukiji, since users can only see a paypal address, where any other private information is hidden.
This will not stop governments from finding users within the network, but it will protect users from other malicious attackers trying to discover their identity.\\

Tsukiji offers a reliable, well-tested, and scalable solution to trading items online, without the weakness of a central point and without requiring any personal information.
